SpacePy Installation Instructions:
=================================

Option 1) to install it in the standard loction (depending on your system)

>>> python setup.py install

Option 2) to install in custom location

>>> python setup.py install --home=/n/packages/lib/python

It is also possible to select a specific compiler for installing the ONERA library. Currently only
'gfortran' and 'pgf' are supported with 'gfortran' being the default. You can select a compiler by e.g. 

>>> python setup.py install --fcompiler=pg

The installer will create a .spacepy directory in your $HOME folder. If you prefer a different location
for this directory, set the environment variable $SPACEPY to a location of your choice. For example,
with a csh, or tcsh you would

>>> setenv SPACEPY /a/different/dir

for the bash shell you would

>>> export SPACEPY=/a/different/dir

Make sure you add the environment variable $SPACEPY to your .cshrc, .tcshrc, or .bashrc script
