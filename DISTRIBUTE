Building spacepy for distribution (20120515)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.
On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will do a binary build as well, since
binaries are needed to build the docs. Thus, sdist will accept compiler
options (and may need them.)

On Windows with Sphinx installed:
copy SpacePy.pdf from the Unix build above into the Doc directory,
since LaTeX is unlikely to work on Windows
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory.
