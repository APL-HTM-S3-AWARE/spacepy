Building spacepy for distribution (20120622)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.

Edit Doc/source/conf.py. Around line 124, remove (DRAFT) from the title.
    Change version around line 68 (two places!)
Change version in setup.py, actual call to setup near bottom.
Change __version__ around line 126 of __init__.py. Also change all through
    the license.

On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will do a binary build as well, since
binaries are needed to build the docs. Thus, sdist will accept compiler
options (and may need them.)

Windows build:
Grab latest mingwget from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
(Installer/mingw-get)
Unzip it, on windows, into C:\MinGW
Put C:\MinGW\bin on the path (right click my computer, properties,
    advanced, environment variables)
Start a command line
mingw-get install gcc g++ mingw32-make fortran
Make a snapshot of the VM, you'll be coming back to this
Install python 2.6 (msi from python.org)
edit path again, append ;c:\Python26;c:\Python26\Scripts
Install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, setuptools, h5py from downloaded exe
Install the CDF library
Make C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg, containing:
    [build]
    compiler=mingw32
easy_install networkx ffnet sphinx numpydoc
unzip the source distribution from the Unix side
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory. Don't worry about the PDF failing.
Run the installer and make sure it works. Copy it out.

Now revert to the snapshot and do it ALL OVER for Python 2.7!

Website is in /n/www/html/spacepy/external
newgroup spacepy
umask 002
under repository, make spacepy-VERSION directory
In here should go:
-.zip and .tar.gz of source
-2.6 and 2.7 of Windows installer
-PDF documentation, called spacepy-VER-doc.pdf
-html documentation spacepy-VER-html_docs.zip. Rooted at build/html.
(DOUBLE CHECK PERMISSIONS)
(in Doc/build/html, zip -r spacepy-VER-html_docs.zip *)
Edit repository.shtml, copy previous version and edit.
Edit download.shtml and update the version number
Unzip the new docs into doc-VER
Move old docs (doc) to doc-OLDVER
Move new docs to doc
Copy new pdf docs into doc, named SpacePy.pdf
(DOUBLE CHECK PERMISSIONS ON DOCS)
edit cgi-bin/register.py, replace old version with new version

Now get the latest on sourceforge:
log in, click on files
in spacepy folder, add folder (spacepy-VER)
upload everything that went into repository on website:
scp * USER@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/spacepy/spacepy/spacepy-VER
In the version folder, click on the "i" next to .tar.gz; set as default for BSD, Linux, Solaris. .zip as default for other, mac; exe as default for windows.

Log in to pypi.python.org
Click on "SpacePy" under "your packages"
Open "show" link for previous version in another window--you will need to copy this all!
Now click "package submission"--yes, it's as if it's new
Copy/paste all that junk over
hide the release until it's propagated out
upload the zip file for the latest documentation

TODO/flesh out:
Put CHANGELOG on website?
