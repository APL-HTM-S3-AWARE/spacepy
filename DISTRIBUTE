Building spacepy for distribution (20120622)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.

Edit Doc/source/conf.py. Around line 124, remove (DRAFT) from the title.
    Change version around line 68 (two places!)
Change version in setup.py, actual call to setup near bottom.
Change __version__ around line 126 of __init__.py. Also change all through
    the license.

On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will do a binary build as well, since
binaries are needed to build the docs. Thus, sdist will accept compiler
options (and may need them.)

Windows build:
Grab latest mingwget from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
(Installer/mingw-get)
Unzip it, on windows, into C:\MinGW
Put C:\MinGW\bin on the path (right click my computer, properties,
    advanced, environment variables)
Start a command line
mingw-get install gcc g++ mingw32-make fortran
Make a snapshot of the VM, you'll be coming back to this
Install python 2.6 (msi from python.org)
edit path again, append ;c:\Python26;c:\Python26\Scripts
Install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, setuptools from downloaded exe
Install the CDF library
Make C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg, containing:
    [build]
    compiler=mingw32
easy_install ffnet sphinx numpydoc
unzip the source distribution from the Unix side
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory. Don't worry about the PDF failing.
Run the installer and make sure it works. Copy it out.

Now revert to the snapshot and do it ALL OVER for Python 2.7!
