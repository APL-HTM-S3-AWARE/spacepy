Building spacepy for distribution (20141223)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.

Edit Doc/source/conf.py. Around line 124, remove (DRAFT) from the title.
    Change version around line 68 (two places!)
Change version in setup.py, actual call to setup near bottom.
Change __version__ around line 126 of __init__.py. Also change all through
    the license.

On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will do a binary build as well, since
binaries are needed to build the docs. Thus, sdist will accept compiler
options (and may need them.)

Windows build:
Follow the "hard way" directions from the installation docs.
unzip the source distribution from the Unix side
(Rebuilding of the source distribution will ensure the latest
docs are in the Windows installer.)
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory.
Run the installer and make sure it works. Copy it out.

Now revert to the snapshot and do it ALL OVER for Python 2.7!

Website is in /n/www/html/spacepy/external
newgroup spacepy
umask 002
under repository, make spacepy-VERSION directory
In here should go:
-.zip and .tar.gz of source
-2.6 and 2.7 of Windows installer
-PDF documentation, called spacepy-VER-doc.pdf
-html documentation spacepy-VER-html_docs.zip. Rooted at build/html.
(DOUBLE CHECK PERMISSIONS)
(in Doc/build/html, zip -r spacepy-VER-html_docs.zip *)
Unzip the new docs into doc-VER
Move old docs (doc) to doc-OLDVER
Move new docs to doc
Copy new pdf docs into doc, named SpacePy.pdf
(DOUBLE CHECK PERMISSIONS ON DOCS)
Put latest CHANGELOG in top level directory of site

Now get the latest on sourceforge:
log in, click on files
in spacepy folder, add folder (spacepy-VER)
upload everything that went into repository on website:
scp * USER@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/spacepy/spacepy/spacepy-VER
In the version folder, click on the "i" next to .tar.gz; set as default for BSD, Linux, Solaris. .zip as default for other, mac; exe as default for windows.

Log in to pypi.python.org
Click on "SpacePy" under "your packages"
Now click "edit" (top bar)
EDIT PKG-INFO from the source distribution tarball, put "Name" field into CamelCase (this should probably be fixed in the installer, or make it not camelcase on pypi)
Upload PKG-INFO (there's a browse button, and then "add package information" DIRECTLY under that)
hide the release until it's propagated out
upload the zip file for the latest documentation
(go to https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=SpacePy and click on "Upload Documentation", basically the same zip file as goes on LANL page)
Same page, file, upload a source distribution.
