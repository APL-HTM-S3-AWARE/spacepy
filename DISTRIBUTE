Building spacepy for distribution (20110823)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.
On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
python setup.py build --rebuild-docs
python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

On Windows with Sphinx installed:
copy SpacePy.pdf from the Unix build above into the Doc directory
python setup.py build --rebuild-docs
python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory.
