Building spacepy for distribution (20120622)
============================================
Since this has to happen on multiple platforms, a single script doesn't work.

Edit Doc/source/conf.py. Around line 124, remove (DRAFT) from the title.
    Change version around line 68 (two places!)
Change version in setup.py, actual call to setup near bottom.
Change __version__ around line 126 of __init__.py. Also change all through
    the license.


On a Unix machine:
check out the latest from git.
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
Tarball and zip are in the dist directory.

Note: building the source distribution will do a binary build as well, since
binaries are needed to build the docs. Thus, sdist will accept compiler
options (and may need them.)

On Windows with Sphinx installed:
copy SpacePy.pdf from the Unix build above into the Doc directory,
since LaTeX is unlikely to work on Windows
    python setup.py bdist_wininst
installer exe is in the dist directory.
