SpacePy: Space Science Tools for Python

SpacePy is a package of tools primarily aimed at the space science 
community. This \_\_init\_\_.py file sets the parameters for import 
statements.

If running the ipython shell, simply type '?' after any command for help. 
ipython also offers tab completion, so hitting tab after '{\textless}module
name{\textgreater}.' will list all available functions, classes and 
variables.

Detailed HTML documentation is available locally in the spacepy/doc 
directory and can be launched by typing: 
{\textgreater}{\textgreater}{\textgreater} spacepy.help()

\textbf{Version:} 0.1dev
